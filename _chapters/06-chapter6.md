title: Chapter 6 - Macroscale cortical dynamics across learning & their disruption in a mouse model of Rett syndrome
description: >-
    In chapter 6, I explore the evolution of cortical dynamics across visuomotor learning in Wt and Mecp2+/- mice. Supplementary material include interactive heatmap and graph models of functional connectivity during learning, as well as videos of the lever-push apparatus and example ∆F/F0 traces during visuomotor behaviour.

### Supplementary Figure 6.1.: The lever-push apparatus

The lever-push Go/NoGo visual discrimination behaviour in action. The mouse is trained to push the lever when the target visual stimulus is present (moving sinusoidal grating; Go) and withhold when the distractor is shown (isoluminant grey; NoGo). Each trial begins with a 6 second inter-trial interval (ITI) when the screen is blank, followed by a 4 second stimulus presentation. The mouse is rewarded with a droplet of 10% sucrose solution for correct responses through a moving spout mounted on a servo motor; you can see it 6 seconds into the video.  The mouse is trained to perform this task for 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week, for a total of 40 sessions.

### Supplementary Figure 6.2.: Session averaged ∆F/F0 trace during the peri-decision epoch in naive Wt mice

Session averaged ∆F/F0 trace from an example Wt mouse during the peri-decision epoch (2 second before and after the lever push). The trace shows the average of 40 trials during the mouse's second session on the Go/NoGo task. The visual stimulus is on 2 seconds into the video, followed by a lever push response roughly 2 seconds later.

### Supplementary Figure 6.3.: Pairwise functional connectivity between areas of interest across the four behavioural periods

Interactive heatmap of functional connectivity Wt and _Mecp2<sup>+/-</sup>_ mice (N=6 per group) across learning in the 4 selected areas of interest; the primary and secondary motor cortices (MOp & MOs), the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and the primary visual area (VISp). Using the drop-down menu on the right of each plot will toggle between the different behavioural periods. Each square represents the correlation in activity between a pair of areas during the epoch between cue presentation and response. Hovering above a square in this plot will reveal the full name of the areas in the pair (as defined in the Allen Brain Atlas) and the associated r value.
