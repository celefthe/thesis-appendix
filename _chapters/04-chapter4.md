title: Chapter 4 - Functional connectivity of the dorsal cortex at rest
description: >-
    This chapter examines whether the reduction in MeCP2 expression affects the flow of information across the dorsal cortex at rest. Supplementary material comprises of interactive heatmaps and graph models of functional connectivity at rest, as well as videos of grooming and quiescent behaviour.

### Supplementary Figure 4.1.: Example of behavioural quiescence in a Wt mouse

Example video of "typical" quiescent behaviour in a Wt mouse. The mouse is sat fairly still in the head-restrain apparatus, not really doing a whole lot.

### Supplementary Figure 4.2.: Example of a grooming bout in a Wt mouse

Example video of "typical" grooming in a Wt mouse. The video shows a mouse grooming its face and head while head-restrained.
