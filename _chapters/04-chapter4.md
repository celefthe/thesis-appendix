title: Chapter 4 - Functional connectivity of the dorsal cortex at rest
description: >-
    This chapter examines whether the reduction in MeCP2 expression affects the flow of information across the dorsal cortex at rest. Supplementary material comprises of interactive heatmaps and graph models of functional connectivity at rest, as well as videos of grooming and quiescent behaviour.

### Supplementary Figure 4.1.: Example of behavioural quiescence in a Wt mouse

Example video of "typical" quiescent behaviour in a Wt mouse. The mouse is sat fairly still in the head-restrain apparatus, not really doing a whole lot.

### Supplementary Figure 4.3.: Map of interareal functional connectivity in Wt mice at 16 weeks

Interactive heatmap of resting-state functional connectivity in 16-week old Wt mice (N=4). Each square represents the Pearson's correlation coefficient _r_ for a pair of cortical areas. Hovering above a square in this plot will reveal the full name of the areas in the pair (as defined in the Allen Brain Atlas) and the associated _r_ value.

### Supplementary Figure 4.4.: Map of interareal functional connectivity in _Mecp2<sup>+/-</sup>_ mice at 16 weeks

Similar to the above. Interactive heatmap of resting-state functional connectivity in 16-week old _Mecp2<sup>+/-</sup>_ mice (N=4). Each square represents the Pearson's correlation coefficient _r_ for a pair of cortical areas. Hovering above a square in this plot will reveal the full name of the areas in the pair (as defined in the Allen Brain Atlas) and the associated _r_ value.

### Supplementary Figure 4.5.: Map of interareal functional connectivity differences between Wt and _Mecp2<sup>+/-</sup>_ mice at 16 weeks

Interactive heatmap of the difference in resting-state functional connectivity between 16-week old Wt and _Mecp2<sup>+/-</sup>_ mice (N=4). Each square represents the difference in Pearson's correlation coefficient _∆r_ for a pair of cortical areas between the two genotypes (_Wt - Mecp2<sup>+/-</sup>_). <span style="color: #326fb9;">Negative</span> values indicate that the correlation is higher in Wt mice (i.e. hypoconnectivity in _Mecp2<sup>+/-</sup>_), while <span style="color: #ab4245;">positive</span> values indicate that the correlation is higher in _Mecp2<sup>+/-</sup>_ mice. Hovering above a square in this plot will reveal the full name of the areas in the pair, the  _∆r_ value with its confidence interval in square brackets and the associated p-value.

### Supplementary Figure 4.6.: Graph projection of the functional resting state networks in 16 week old Wt and _Mecp2<sup>+/-</sup>_ mice

Interactive graph projection of the resting state functional connectivity networks of 16 week old Wt and _Mecp2<sup>+/-</sup>_ mice. Each node (circles) represents a cortical area, while edges (lines) represent significant (direct) functional connections between pairs of nodes. Hovering above a node will reveal its full name and the region it belongs to (<span style="color:#cccc11;">visual</span>, <span style="color:#7fc97f;">motor</span>, <span style="color: #fb9a99;">somatosensory</span> or <span style="color:#beaed4"> retrosplenial</span>), while clicking a node will visually isolate the direct network connections it is involved in (click the blank space to reset).

### Supplementary Figure 4.7.: Topographical differences between Wt and _Mecp2<sup>+/-</sup>_ resting state networks at 16 weeks

Interactive map of topographical differences between Wt and _Mecp2<sup>+/-</sup>_ resting state networks. Each square in this map represents a functional connection between two areas. <span style="color: #326fb9;">Blue</span> squares indicate connections present only in the modelled networks of Wt mice (i.e. absent in _Mecp2<sup>+/-</sup>_), while <span style="color: #ab4245;">red</span> squares indicate connections found only in _Mecp2<sup>+/-</sup>_ networks. White squares indicate no difference. Hovering above a square in this plot will reveal the full name of the areas in the pair.

Interactive heatmap of the difference in resting-state functional connectivity Wt and _Mecp2<sup>+/-</sup>_ mice (N=4) at 16, 20 and 24 weeks. Use the slider on the right hand side of the plot to switch between different age points. Each square represents the difference in Pearson's correlation coefficient _∆r_ for a pair of cortical areas between the two genotypes (_Wt - Mecp2<sup>+/-</sup>_). <span style="color: #326fb9;">Negative</span> values indicate that the correlation is higher in Wt mice (i.e. hypoconnectivity in _Mecp2<sup>+/-</sup>_), while <span style="color: #ab4245;">positive</span> values indicate that the correlation is higher in _Mecp2<sup>+/-</sup>_ mice. Hovering above a square in this plot will reveal the full name of the areas in the pair, the  _∆r_ value with its confidence interval in square brackets and the associated p-value.

Using the _Behaviour_ slider on the right hand side of the plot to switch between different age points, while the _Genotype_ toggle can be used to select which genotype to display. Each node (circles) represents a cortical area, while edges (lines) represent significant (direct) functional connections between pairs of nodes. Hovering above a node will reveal its full name and the region it belongs to (<span style="color:#cccc11;">visual</span>, <span style="color:#7fc97f;">motor</span>, <span style="color: #fb9a99;">somatosensory</span> or <span style="color:#beaed4"> retrosplenial</span>), while clicking a node will visually isolate the direct network connections it is involved in (click the blank space to reset).
